# imageMetadataApp
Personal app, which can be used to store URL and various data into an image files for sorting purposes

This is also a python coding practice for myself.

# Purpose of this App

As an artist, I tend to seek the internet for reference art quite a lot and sometimes I tend to save the files on my reference folder for future usage (especially when offline copies are needed). In my past attempts to create the app for it, I had decided to store the URL into the image's filename as a quick solution, which later on (while ending up being sufficient for my own need), was a hinderance related to sorting images and finding specific ones very time consuming process.

I also would prefer the app having a some kind of graphic user-interface.

After few iterations of the application and dabbling with the graphic user-interface aspect, I came to conclusion of the app lacking the previously mentioned features and a complete re-work needed as being able to edit the filenames would help a lot with the sorting system I had. The old app also had the issue of not working 100% time if the URL contained certain characters.
