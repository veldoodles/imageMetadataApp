# imageMetadataApp
Personal app, which can be used to store URL and various data into an image files for sorting/storing purposes.
This is also a coding practice for myself.

# Purpose of this App

Store URL data and possible extra data into an image file itself, while avoiding utilizing "database" for storing the image information. 
#### Additional features:
- Utilize the application to perform quick edits of the metadata
- Fetch image data from the clipboard to speed up saving process
- Both "Drag and drop" file into the application and filebrowser
- Graphical User Interface for ease of use
- Support for the legacy "imageMetadataApp" applications, where the URL was stored in the "file name" (and possibly convert old files into new ones automatically when detected?)

#### Potential features, if possible:
- Test URLs found from the images (does the URL work anymore and such, example: twitter "tweet containing the image deleted")
