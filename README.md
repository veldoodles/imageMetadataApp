# imageMetadataApp
Personal app, which can be used to store URL and various data into an image files for sorting purposes
This is also a python coding practice for myself.

# Purpose of this App

As an artist, I tend to seek the internet for reference art quite a lot and sometimes I tend to save the files on my reference folder for future usage (especially when offline copies are needed). In my past attempts to create the app for it, I had decided to store the URL into the image's filename as a quick solution, which later on (while ending up being sufficient for my own need), ended up being annoying to deal with as I cannot give the files unique names, which would help with sorting and I have had to rely on folder sorting (while it can work, finding specific images can be a hazzle if I don't exactly remember where I stored it and going through 50+ folder to find it can be time consuming.

I also would prefer the app having a some kind of graphic user-interface.

After few iterations of the application and dabbling with the graphic user-interface aspect, I came to conclusion of the app lacking the previously mentioned features and a complete re-work needed as being able to edit the filenames would help a lot with the sorting system I had. The old app also had the issue of not working 100% time if the URL contained certain characters, which I had not acconted for.

New goal for the app is to find a way to store the "URL" into the metadata of the images, along side any additional information I'd want to store there. I'm also considering adding tags to it to aid sorting if I ever need to sort them.
